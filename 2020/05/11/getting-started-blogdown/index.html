      <h1 id="your-mission-should-you-choose-to-accept-it">Your mission, should you choose to accept it&hellip;</h1>
<p>I recently stumbled back across an <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">essay</a> that I remember caught my attention a couple years back.  Its premise: if you want to be a data scientist, start a blog.  It&rsquo;ll give you practice, help you build a portfolio, and attract constructive critical feedback.</p>
<p>As an aspiring data scientist, what else could I do but take this excellent advice?  Although I think I may be on the wrong Internet for that last point :-/</p>
<p>Now, when I start a project in a new domain, I&rsquo;m generally pretty conservative about the toolchain and options I use.  I want to get a minimum viable product with as few new buzzwords as possible, and <em>then</em> I can pivot to using the sixteen different pieces of whizz-bang software that all the thought leaders are raving about.</p>
<p>This is a problem because, the last time I did any serious blogging, the typical choice was between LiveJournal or hand-coded HTML, and something called &ldquo;Wordpress&rdquo; was the new hotness.  My domain knowledge has not aged well&hellip;  It&rsquo;s even <em>more</em> of a problem than it would usually be because, for various lockdown-related reasons, I&rsquo;m attempting to blog from my work laptop, which won&rsquo;t let me install arbitrary software.  No Wordpress for me :(</p>
<h1 id="blogdown--github-pages--win--maybe">Blogdown + GitHub Pages = Win?  Maybe?</h1>
<p>Fortunately, I have R/RStudio and Git installed on my work laptop, with the necessary permissions to install R packages via the former.  This leads me to the natural choice of using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host my site, and <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">R Blogdown</a> as my static content generator.</p>
<p>R Blogdown is part of the same series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming</a> packages as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> and <a href="https://bookdown.org/">R Bookdown</a>.  They&rsquo;re all produced by the same person, <a href="https://yihui.org/">Yi Hui</a>, who is up there with Hadley Wickham in the R pantheon.  Literate programming, which I only stumbled across recently via the JHU Data Science specialisation on Coursera, is an alternative programming paradigm for producing truly self-documenting analysis.  It works incredibly well in a data science context, and R Markdown in particular is my go-to tool for any shallow analysis.</p>
<p>Less fortunately, R Blogdown + GitHub Pages is not <em>entirely</em> a supported configuration.  The <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/github-pages.html">Blogdown manual</a> quite heavily steers you towards an apparently-more-sophisticated alternative called <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.  Which I&rsquo;ve never heard of before, and don&rsquo;t have the first clue how to take full advantage of, so have promptly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_13">filed</a> under Not This Time Buddy.</p>
<h1 id="r-ing-tfm">R-ing TFM</h1>
<p>Being a typical techie, my first attempt was without any reference to the written documentation.  I ran <code>install.packages(&quot;blogdown&quot;)</code> and, after one scary moment when the progress bar went up to ~4000%, it installed perfectly.  I then created a new repository on GitHub called &ldquo;AlexLabram.github.io&rdquo;, cloned it locally via R Studio&rsquo;s New Project / Version Control dialog option^[I&rsquo;ve so far managed to avoid getting to grips with Git&rsquo;s command line.  Not sure how far I&rsquo;ll be able to stick to that policy, but I&rsquo;m holding out as long as I can.], and ran <code>blogdown::new_site()</code> to populate it.  Committed changes, pushed to GitHub, checked the <a href="https://alexlabram.github.io">site link</a> and&hellip; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Nho44lGVV8">that&rsquo;s not a website</a>, that&rsquo;s a README file.</p>
<p>The key problem, as <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/github-pages.html">outlined</a> in the Blogdown manual, is that GitHub Pages expects the site index to be in the root folder, whereas Blogdown expects it to be in the /public subdirectory.  According to the <em>GitHub Pages</em> <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">manual</a>, it should be possible to change this&hellip; but, where there&rsquo;s supposed to be a dropdown in the GitHub settings page, I just see the message &ldquo;User pages must be built from the master branch.&rdquo;  Helpful.</p>
<p>Plan B, after reading the Blogdown help page, is to split my work into two repositories.  The first, imaginatively named &ldquo;blog_source&rdquo;, contains the Blogdown R project, as produced via New Project / New Directory / Website Using Blogdown.  The second, named &ldquo;AlexLabram.github.io&rdquo;, contains the actual static site.  A Blogdown configuration option, <code>publishDir = &quot;../AlexLabram.github.io&quot;</code>, is used to point the one at the other.</p>
<p>There are a couple of subtle annoyances here.  Firstly - and this may well be unique to me - I had great fun convincing RStudio that I wanted to create a Blogdown site, apply version control <em>and</em> link it to an existing (empty) GitHub repository.  This is the first and only time in my life I&rsquo;ve genuinely needed to drop down into the Git shell, in order to run <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/AlexLabram/blog_source</code>.</p>
<p>Secondly, for ReasonsTM, GitHub Pages expects a site generated by the tool Jekyll, to which it needs to apply various post-processing.  To <em>stop</em> this happening, you have to include a special indicator file called &ldquo;.nojekyll&rdquo;.  Which in Windows is impossible to create via the GUI (thanks, Bill).  Running <code>file.create(&quot;.nojekyll&quot;)</code> in R works fine though.</p>
<p>After fixing those issues up, I pushed the static site repository to GitHub, fired up my web-browser, and&hellip; nope.  The <a href="https://github.com/AlexLabram/AlexLabram.github.io">GitHub repository</a> is full of relevant files, but attempting to <em>view</em> the site just gets me a 404 error.</p>
<p>Back to the drawing board.</p>
<h1 id="the-great-bug-hunt">The Great Bug Hunt</h1>
<p>On investigation, I found that specifying the webpage in my URL meant everything Just Worked - it was only when I dropped the &ldquo;/index.html&rdquo; suffix that things fell apart.  That at least meant the issues was a GitHub Pages problem rather than a Blogdown problem.</p>
<p>A bit of digging brought me to <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/index-html-not-working/td-p/1266">this thread</a> in GitHub&rsquo;s help forums, wherein people have identified about a dozen different</p>
<p>Some of the suggested solutions would require invasive changes to my Blogdown installation.  In the spirit of the drunken man and the streetlight, I first tried <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Pages/index-html-not-working/m-p/42858/highlight/true#M2473">an option</a> that seemed fairly easy to implement: adding an empty config file.  Worth a try, but no obvious reason why it would work&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;so of course it worked perfectly.  What.</p>
<h1 id="kicking-the-tyres">Kicking the tyres</h1>
<p>After getting the demo site up and running, there were of course a few things I needed to test.  Most importantly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Could I regenerate the site without messing up the bugfix?</li>
<li>Could I create blog posts within the site and publish them?</li>
<li>Could I <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">wire it up</a> to my existing personal domain (which has been without website for about a decade)?</li>
<li>Could I produce interesting and engaging content?</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to confirm that #1 seems to be working OK (breath: held).  I&rsquo;m going to leave #3 for a later date - had enough technical turmoil for one evening.  And #4 is <em>clearly</em> a pipe dream :-P</p>
<p>Item #2, creating a new page, is a bit more convoluted.  This is largely because Bookdown is built on top of another static site generator called Hugo - it&rsquo;s basically a wrapper that adds R Markdown support.  This means that you have to know at least a little about Hugo.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content goes in the /content folder (quelle surprise).  You can apparently lay this out however you damn well please.  Hugo will then rifle through its pockets looking for loose .md files.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a special markup language (key/value store) for configuration options.  The admissible keys are different for each Hugo theme.  Be afraid.</li>
<li>The Hugo documentation is somewhat terrifying.  Take note of Yi Hui&rsquo;s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html#fn3">comment</a> on the subject, and then recall that he is almost certainly smarter than you.  Abandon all hope, ye who RTFM here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking personally, I stumbled across the following minor issues in creating a blog post (this one!) from an <a href="https://github.com/AlexLabram/blog_source/blob/master/content/post/2020-05-11-getting-started-with-blogdown.Rmd">R Notebook</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>R Blogdown&rsquo;s site preview tool doesn&rsquo;t like the whole &ldquo;split across two repositories&rdquo; concept.  At all.  After some coaxing (i.e. manually locating the index.html file and opening it in Chrome), it would display the site without any formatting or images.  Meh, good enough for checking.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;date&rdquo; parameter in a Notebook&rsquo;s YAML header is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRVExJZKIT8">load-bearing</a>.  I initially tried just specifying it as &ldquo;2020-05-11&rdquo;; it filed the blog post under date 0001-01-01.  A subsequent attempt using the full UTC date string (&ldquo;2020-05-11T20:26:00+00:00&rdquo;) caused the post to be entirely ignored for rendering purposes, which I ultimately traced down to the year value but still can&rsquo;t explain.  Eventually I gave up and used RStudio&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Post&rdquo; tool (in the Addins menu on the toolbar).</li>
<li>The New Post tool doesn&rsquo;t add a &ldquo;.md&rdquo; suffix to a Markdown file unless you tell it to.  It&rsquo;s still better than creating pages manually, though.</li>
<li>The site builder tool doesn&rsquo;t delete previously-generated content, even if you&rsquo;ve deleted the corresponding .md/.Rmd file.  You have to empty out the</li>
<li>Said purge should not extend to the /gitkeep, .nojekyll and _config.yml files, nor to the .git subfolder.  D&rsquo;oh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having ploughed through all those issues, I <em>finally</em> seem to have a working site.  Now I just need to customise the site&rsquo;s appearance and metadata.  Joy.</p>
<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h1>
<ul>
<li>Setting up new infrastructure is never ever easy, no matter how straightforward it&rsquo;s alleged to be.  Budget your time, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">SAN points</a> and alcohol accordingly.</li>
<li>Learning how to use the Git shell is probably worth the effort, even if your IDE includes a pretty front-end that provides <em>most</em> of the same functionality.</li>
<li>Just because a thousand other people are using a content management system, doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t have really dumb issues.</li>
</ul>
