      <description>This post is a log of publicly-available content I&amp;rsquo;ve produced for third parties. I&amp;rsquo;ll update it in future as new stuff lands.
IFoA DS-MIG I&amp;rsquo;ve written on data science for the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, the UK&amp;rsquo;s actuarial professional body, as part of my involvement in their Data Science Member Interest Group (I&amp;rsquo;m a workstream lead). These are aimed at a professional audience, so if you&amp;rsquo;re used to Medium.com-style articles then you may find them a bit turgid, but they hopefully provide a good overview of a few key topics.</description>

In its incarnation as a technical term, what it really represents is:
 The convergence of data analysis techniques from a wide range of scientific fields. Until recently, every scientific field had its own techniques and terminology.</description>
