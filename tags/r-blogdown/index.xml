      <description>Your mission, should you choose to accept it…I recently stumbled back across an essay that I remember caught my attention a couple years back. Its premise: if you want to be a data scientist, start a blog. It’ll give you practice, help you build a portfolio, and attract constructive critical feedback.
As an aspiring data scientist, what else could I do but take this excellent advice? Although I think I may be on the wrong Internet for that last point :-/</description>
